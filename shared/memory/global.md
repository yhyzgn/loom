## Spring Boot 4.x migration / upgrade

When the user mentions Spring Boot version migration, Spring Boot upgrade, or upgrading to Spring Boot 4.x, automatically consult and follow the official Spring Boot 4.0 Migration Guide:
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-4.0-Migration-Guide

Additional local preference for Jackson configuration during Spring Boot 4.x migrations:
- Prefer using/providing the `JsonMapper` bean first.
- Only add compatibility for an `ObjectMapper` bean when it is actually necessary for existing integrations or third-party code.
